## what is this?
i'm not sure if i'll finish this project, i'm just having fun for now before the project's fun curve ends
## what is this for?
this is a database manager with better UI (made by backend developer) not sure about the UI but i think it will be better than most database managers so trying my best to install the best templates (frontend is shit)
